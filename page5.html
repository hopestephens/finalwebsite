<h2> Plants for Beginners </h2>
<h3>Peperomia</h3>

<p>he Peperomia is a great feature piece on a table, desk or shelf. There are over 1000 species of Peperomia to choose from and they come with thick waxy drought-tolerant leaves in variegated, solid, or marbled red, purple, gray, or green shades.
<br>Peperomia are chosen for their beautiful, ornamental leaves, which come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and colors, depending on the variety.
<br>The Peperomia makes for a great houseplant for beginners because it’s quite forgiving and can withstand a decent amount of neglect. The plant can grow alone or grouped with other varieties for interest. It doesn’t often grow over 12 inches tall and while it requires medium to bright light, it is not too sensitive to light fluctuations.
<br>Provide the plant with loamy potting soil (it also enjoys chunky orchid potting medium) with good drainage, place it in a bright room (it does not require direct sunlight) and water it once the top half of the soil is dry. That’s all that’s required to keep your Peperomia growing happily.</p>
<h3>Spider Plant</h3>

<p>The Spider Plant, aka Hen & Chicken Plant or ribbon plant, is a popular houseplant for beginners. This elegant plant features long, sword-like green, cream, and white leaves that grow from a central point at the base.
<br>These plants are tough, easy to grow and require minimal maintenance. They do best in hanging baskets, but also thrive when placed on a table or shelf in a bright room (no direct sunlight required). It is a highly-adaptable houseplant, as it can grow in almost any environment when given time to “settle”.
<br>The Spider Plant has no adverse reactions to being moved to a new environment, so you won’t have to worry about moving it about your home.
<br>All that is required is a bright spot and moist soil to keep a Spider Plant happy. Only water your Spider Plant if the soil is dry. Be careful not to overwater the plant as it can lead to wilting and root rot.</p>
<h3>Fiddle Leaf Fig</h3>

<p>The Fiddle Leaf Fig is a trendy houseplant and features in many fashion-forward interior décor magazines. This is a tall columnar plant that doesn’t get very bushy. It’s a great filler and an interesting piece for corners and tight spaces. The leaves are big, waxy, dark green, and shaped like a violin, hence the name.
<br>There’s a misconception that the Fiddle Leaf Fig is difficult to care for. Native to the tropics, this particular houseplant loves warm, wet, and humid environments, which isn’t always easy to provide in the average home. Don’t let that scare you off though.
<br>Simply provide the Fiddle Leaf Fig with bright filtered light and plenty of water, and it will thank you for it by flourishing.
<br>The Fiddle Leaf Fig does require a bit more attention than the average houseplant, so it’s only really suited to a beginner who has time and interest in the plant. It is a species that is susceptible to disease and pest infestation and often you will find such a plant with leaf fungi or disease spots. They can also start to drop their leaves if they are exposed to drafts, big temperature fluctuations, and humidity levels that keep changing.
<br>Despite this, the Fiddle Leaf Fig can be a great plant to get if you want to hone your skills in houseplant care while enjoying the stunning foliage.</p>
