<h2> Plants for Intermediate Gardeners</h2>
<h3>Azalea</h3>

<p>Planted outdoors, azalea explodes with vibrantly colorful blooms in a spring spectacle that makes the shrub a forever favorite. So it's only natural that shoppers feel tempted by the indoor, florist’s azalea for sale at local stores. However, the fine print is that, unless you take special care, the party isn't going to last long. First, indoor azalea likes it cool and humid, a combination it can be tricky to create artificially. Also, indoor azalea needs slightly acidic soil, meaning that unless you repot it, vinegar must be added to all the water you give the plant. Note that indoors, azalea insists on damp (not soggy) soil at all times. Do all of the above, and you can keep azalea going strong indoors.</p>
<h3>Wandering Jew</h3>

<p>A vining growth habit—that’s a gift and a curse for the inchplant, better known as the wandering jew. In a hanging basket, the distinctive, purple-and-silver-striped leaves gently cascade down, glistening in the light and looking beautiful. But over time, as the tendrils get longer and the leaves get fewer and farther in between, wandering jew begins to look sickly, even if it's thriving. There's only one way to keep the plant looking its best: You need to pinch back the growing tips, and you need to do that over and over to keep pace with a plant whose growth speed often makes it an invasive species outdoors. The good news? Beyond its unusually demanding grooming requirements, wandering jew doesn't need any other extra, abnormal care.</p>
<h3>Boston Fern</h3>

<p>This lush, leafy plant can give your home serious jungle vibes—as long as you can successfully mimic the growing conditions of its first home, the tropical and sub-tropical rainforests. Without warmer temperatures, high humidity, and lots of filtered light, a sad fern will shed its leaves. Fortunately, if you're up to the challenge, there are ways to satisfy the plant's needs without sacrificing your home's comfort. First, set your fern by an east or west-facing window that receives plenty of indirect sunlight. If possible, choose a location near a heat vent that can be closed and opened as needed: While the plant grows in a moderate 65 to 75 degrees during the day, a 10-degree dip in the evening prevents fungus growth. Finally, run a humidifier nearby to keep the air around the fern from drying out (especially in winter).</p>
