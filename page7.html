<h2> Plants for Experienced Gardeners</h2>
<h3>Bonsai</h3>

<p>Bonsai trees are basically miniature trees that you can grow at home. The art of Bonsai has found its way from Japan to the homes of plant enthusiasts from all over the world.
However, taking care for Bonsais is certainly not an easy task.
First of all, one needs to understand that many trees are not suitable to be cultivated as Bonsais in the first place. There are only a couple of trees that make for good Bonsais. Two of them are certainly the Ficus Bonsai and the Fukien Tea.
In order to keep these little trees happy & thriving, careful care is an absolute must.
For instance, you need to make sure that these bonsais get a good amount of light and you will also need to cultivate them in special soil that is soil specifically for bonsai trees.
To sum up, cultivating Bonsais is certainly a very fulfilling hobby, yet it is connected with a certain amount of work and dedication. </p>
<h3>Gardenia</h3>

<p>Gardenias are not exactly low-maintenance houseplants. They don’t like to be neglected at all. They don’t like low humidity either. Also, they don’t like too much sunlight.
In fact, there are a whole lot of things that Gardenias don’t like. And as far as temperatures go, Gardenias like cool nights (about 16 degrees) and warmer temperatures during the day (about 23 degrees).
To put it simply: Gardenia Care is pretty difficult. And flower buds will often fail to form if you don’t respect the temperatures as outlined earlier on. Or maybe they will indeed form but will fall off later. That could be due to overwatering. There’s really a lot that can go wrong with this beautiful evergreen shrub.
But the sheer beauty of Gardenias, its creamy-white flowers and the intoxicating fragrance make it all worth it, right?
One thing’s for sure, though: If one day, you’ll see your Gardenia blooming (usually happens in late spring and then again in fall), you should consider yourself really really lucky. </p>
<h3>Maidenhair Fern</h3>

<p>What does make the Maidenhair fern so tricky to grow?
First of all, the Maidenhair fern needs a lot of humidity to survive and thrive. If you won’t bless this fussy fern with high humidity levels, it certainly won’t last long.
So, if you are indeed accepting the challenge and aspire to cultivate this fussy fern as an indoor houseplant, make sure to keep it in a humid environment.
The bathroom is an ideal place for the Maidenhair fern, as this is typically the room where the humidity is the highest.
Apart from that, it needs to be pointed out that you should cultivate your Adantium raddianum in a shady spot.
Direct sunlight won’t be forgiven by this plant and could literally kill your fern for good.
Last but not least, your Maidenhair fern is a moisture-loving plant. Keep the substrate moist. Water again when the top layer of soil (about 1 cm) is dry. </p>
