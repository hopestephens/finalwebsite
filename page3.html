<h2> Advice for Intermediate Plant Owners </h2>
<h3>Give your plants enough light</h3>
<p>Light is the most important environmental factor to keep houseplants healthy. They need it for photosynthesis. If you’ve got decent light levels, they will photosynthesise more than they respire. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t grow.</p>
<h3> Choose the window you put your plants in front of</h3>
<p>When the Sun is shining through south-facing windows, you get the most intense light. So that’s where you put your cacti and bromeliads.
North-facing windows rarely get direct sunlight, so this is where you put plants intolerant of bright light, so things like maidenhair fern.
East- and west-facing windows get intermediate light levels, so the epipremnums and tradescantia do well.</p>
<h3>LED lights help plants grow</h3>
<p>Modern cool white LED lights give off a much more balanced daylight light spectrum than old filament bulbs. So a plant that’s directly under an LED is going to get a useful quantity of additional photosynthetic light.</p>
<h3>Give your indoor plants a nutrient boost</h3>
<p>Most composts used for growing houseplants will have had their nutrients leached out by watering within six to eight weeks. Through the summer, when there’s plenty of light and reasonable warmth, I dilute liquid fertiliser down to about one-tenth of the recommended strength and use that in my weekly watering.</p>
